<!-- Task Summary: 

 
Using Django Rest Framework, create an API endpoint for “fizzbuzzes” that supports 3 operations: retrieve, list, and create. 
 
GET /fizzbuzz                       to list all fizzbuzz objects 
GET /fizzbuzz/123              to retrieve a single fizz buzz object 
POST /fizzbuzz                    to create a new fizzbuzz object 
 
The endpoint has been documented in detail here: http://docs.fizzbuzz.apiary.io 
 
When you’ve completed the code, please upload it to a public git repo and send me the link. 
 
Notes: 

Don’t worry about setting up a postgres db, just use the stock sqllite dev database that Django uses by default.  

Don't worry about hosting, either. To test your endpoint, I will run your code locally and use the Browsable API: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/browsable-api/ 

Use best practices and common sense for field names, default values, validation, unit tests, etc. 

Bonus tasks: If you breeze through the above exercise and want to tackle something a little harder, here are two more features to implement: 

Write Unit Tests to cover basic functionality, using factories or fixtures to populate mock data. 

Document your code (through Docstrings, perhaps? Or in a method of your own choosing)  -->
